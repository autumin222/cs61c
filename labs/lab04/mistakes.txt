1. at the start of the maploop, need to take the address of the first item of the array
not just copy the pointer
    add t1, s0, x0 -> lw t1, 0(s0)
2. we need to get the next position of the array according to the counter t0

    slli t3, t0, 2      # there are 4 bits cost by the int
    add t1, t1, t3      # offset the array address by the count

3. caller save the t1, because the func uses the t1

    addi sp, sp, -4     # caller save volatile register t1
    sw t1, 0(sp)

    jalr s1             # call the function on that value.

    lw t1, 0(sp)
    addi sp, sp, 4
4. la a0, 8(s0) -> lw a0, 8(s0)
5. lw a1, s1, 0 ->addi a1, s1, 0
